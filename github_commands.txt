# After creating a new repository on GitHub, run these commands to push your code:

# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# If you want to use SSH instead of HTTPS:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
# git branch -M main
# git push -u origin main

# If prompted for GitHub credentials, you'll need to create a Personal Access Token:
# 1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
# 2. Give it a name, set an expiration, and select at least the 'repo' scope
# 3. Use this token as your password when prompted (your username remains the same)

# If you want to avoid entering credentials repeatedly, you can set up credential caching:
# git config --global credential.helper cache
